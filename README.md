# automator-type-clipboard-contents
Mac Automator service to type out the contents of the clipboard as keystrokes.

Made this for a weird situation where normal paste was disabled.

Install by double-clicking the `.workflow` folder in Finder, then add a keyboard shortcut for it under:

    System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts tab > Services > General

I used ⌥⌘V as the shortcut.
