# automator-type-clipboard-contents
Mac Automator service to type out the contents of the clipboard as keystrokes.

I made this for a weird situation where normal paste was disabled.

## Installation

    git clone https://github.com/treythomas123/automator-type-clipboard-contents
    cd automator-type-clipboard-contents
    open type-clipboard-contents.workflow

Then add a keyboard shortcut for it under:

    System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts tab > Services > General

I used ⌥⌘V as the shortcut.
